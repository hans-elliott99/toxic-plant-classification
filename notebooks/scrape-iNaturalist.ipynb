    "# Web Scraping iNaturalist\n",
    "[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is an interesting and useful source of biological image data. Users provide (often high-quality) images of plants, bugs, and other orgnaisms by uploading them through an app, and it solves the problem of data labeling since labels (for example, what species of plant) are crowd-sourced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I scrape photos of common toxic or rash plants in North America (like poison oak or poison ivy) as well as common nontoxic plants which are often confused with their toxic counterparts. The end goal is to train a model that can classify a plant image and help determine if it is one of the toxic species. [The dataset created by this notebook can be found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hanselliott/toxic-plant-classification) \n",
    "\n",
    "If decent results can be achieved, this model can be deployed as an app. Once again, this makes iNaturalist an exciting data source, considering that users of iNaturalist tend to submit photos taken from their phone, and a plant classification app would rely on phone-taken photos as well."
